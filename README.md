# ![RecCore Logo](REC.png)

RecCore is a lightweight operating system kernel designed specifically for ARM64 architecture, written entirely in C. It focuses on efficient task scheduling, memory management, and device driver support. This kernel system supports only ARM64 architecture; 32-bit systems are not supported. System drives and network mounts are located under the `drives` directory. Future plans include a Flex version with a modern user interface (UI).

## **Warnings**
**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Non-Debug (Non-Open Source) Versions Are Strictly Prohibited from Being Unpacked!**  
Any unauthorized unpacking, including but not limited to extracting unreleased components and incorporating them into distribution versions, will face legal action. We reserve the right to pursue legal responsibility.  
**Special Warning**: If anyone is found replacing or tampering with `lab` files, we will take immediate legal action without tolerance!  
**Legal Notice**: Any unauthorized actions will result in legal notices, and violators will bear the consequences!

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note: UI and Command Features Are Not Yet Complete!**  
The current version of the RecCore kernel has not yet completed the development of the user interface (UI) and command-line tools (Command). Please do not use these incomplete features in production environments. We are actively developing them, so stay tuned for updates.

## **Features**
- **ARM64 Exclusive Support**: Optimized for ARM64 architecture only.
- **Efficient Task Scheduling**: Priority-based round-robin scheduling algorithm.
- **Memory Management**: Provides virtual memory management and physical memory allocation.
- **Drive Mounting Support**: System drives and network mounts are located under the `drives` directory.
- **Modular Design**: Kernel features are modular, supporting dynamic loading and unloading.

## **Quick Start**

### **Compiling the Kernel**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RecCore.git
   cd RecCore
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu qemu-system-arm
   ```
3. Compile the kernel:
   ```bash
   make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- all
   ```

### **Running the Kernel**
1. Run using QEMU:
   ```bash
   qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu cortex-a53 -kernel bin/RecCore-arm64.bin
   ```
2. Debug mode:
   ```bash
   qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu cortex-a53 -kernel bin/RecCore-arm64.bin -s -S
   ```
   In another terminal, start GDB:
   ```bash
   gdb-multiarch -ex "target remote localhost:1234" -ex "symbol-file bin/RecCore-arm64.bin"
   ```

## **Drive and Network Mounting**

### **System Drive (drives/system)**
- **Functionality**: System drive is mounted under `drives/system`.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  mount /dev/sdX /drives/system
  ```

### **Network Mount (drives/network)**
- **Functionality**: Network mount is located under `drives/network`.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  mount -t nfs 192.168.1.100:/remote/path /drives/network
  ```
